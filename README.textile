h2. Flags Helper

*Version:* v0.2
*Author:* Demostenes Garcia (me@demogar.com / www.demogar.com)


h2. DESCRIPTION

This is a *CodeIgniter Helper*. It makes a dropdown select with a list of Countries. The value of the country is determined by the 'ISO 3166-1 alpha-2' codes.
It's a perfect solution if you need a list of countries usable with the famfamfam flags.

I also added the fam fam fam flags in gif format.

h2. USAGE

It's quite simple:
@	# We load the helper
	$this->load->helper('flags');
	
	# Then we echo the dropdown. The first value is the name of the dropdown and the second value is the default value.
	echo select_countries('flags', 'pa'); @
